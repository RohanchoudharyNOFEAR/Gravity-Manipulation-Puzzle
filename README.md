I want to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to work on this assignment.
I was little  short on time as there was another project to deal with, i tried my best to complete the assignment but i am assuring you
that i can do much better than that.  

The assignment leaned more towards being logic-oriented rather than structurally complex. 
While I was able to complete it, 
I didnâ€™t have the chance to showcase my understanding of design patterns, SOLID principles.
However, I want to reassure you that I possess a solid understanding of clean architecture and refactoring techniques.

I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and improving my skills in writing clean,
maintainable code, particularly by learning from senior developers.

Once again, thank you for this opportunity. I look forward to any future collaboration and growth.

Best regards,
Rohan Choudhary
